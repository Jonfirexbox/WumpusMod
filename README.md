# Modlog Intergration
**If you would like WumpusMod to log all events into a modlog create a channel called ``modlog`` and allow WumpusMod to read and send messages in that channel.**

# Selfhosting
**Selfhosting for WumpusMod is allowed but support will not be provided, if you break the bot do not expect for the support team to fix it.**
